## Key Features

### Tailwind CSS

All components use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling. You can customize the theme in `tailwind.config.js`.

### React Components

React components can be used alongside Astro components. Use the `client:` directive to control hydration:

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately on page load
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when component is visible

### MDX Support

Write your documentation in MDX format to combine Markdown with React components.
